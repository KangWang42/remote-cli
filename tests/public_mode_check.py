"""A relay for everyone, end to end. First the Windows program as installed (run after tools/package_windows.py):
with such a relay in the published list, choosing it gives this computer a place of its own there without anything
being typed, shows neither the address nor the password, and keeps the place for the next start; a place the relay
removed is asked for again. Then the agent alone in such a place: a terminal is started, typed into and read by a
phone under that place's address. The relay and the list are made here; ports 8744 (the program's own relay) and 8746.
