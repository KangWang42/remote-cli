"""The "中转" tab of the Windows program with a relay of one's own, as installed (run after tools/package_windows.py):
opening the tab changes nothing; a relay that refuses the password leaves the connection in use as it was and says
why, and is not saved; a relay that accepts it is saved and switched to; "重新连接" with the tab open connects to the
relay the field shows; a relay kept by an earlier version becomes the first of the saved ones. The program presses
its own controls (--screenshot ... own) and writes what came of it; the relay is one started here. Uses temporary data
folders and ports 8744 and 8745.
